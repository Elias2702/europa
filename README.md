# Hey, Europa...

This web app is a prototype developed at the [Single Digital Gateway](https://europa.eu/newsroom/events/brussels-single-digital-gateway-hackathon_en) hackathon sponsored by the European Commission, in Brussels (Belgium), March 2019.
It is meant only for pitching magic purposes, not as a technical proof of concept.

Coded with React. No back-end. Mobile first.

The voice-recognition / text input feature is set to react to the word 'form'.
Speech-to-text is activated by a click anywhere on the screen (body). Try it and see what happens! ;)

Hackathon team consisted of:

- [Samuel Degueldre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-degueldre-60507842/)
